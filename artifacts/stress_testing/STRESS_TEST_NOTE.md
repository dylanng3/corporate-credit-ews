## Sectoral Analysis (Severe Recession)

| Sector | EAD ($M) | NPL ($M) | Î” NPL ($M) | Provision ($M) |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|----------------|
| Manufacturing | 102.1 | 35.6 | +29.1 | 16.0 |
| Retail | 102.3 | 35.5 | +29.0 | 16.0 |

## Grade Migration Impact (Severe Recession)

| Grade | Baseline NPL ($M) | Stressed NPL ($M) | Î” NPL ($M) | % Increase |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| A | 2.9 | 6.9 | +4.0 | +138% |
| B | 5.7 | 14.2 | +8.5 | +149% |
| C | 12.0 | 29.9 | +17.9 | +149% |
| D | 24.1 | 59.4 | +35.3 | +146% |
| E | 34.6 | 86.1 | +51.5 | +149% |
| F | 54.7 | 134.3 | +79.6 | +146% |
| G | 109.5 | 267.3 | +157.8 | +144% |

**Key Observations:**
- Higher grades show proportionally larger increases (leverage effect)
- Grade E-G contribute 75% of total NPL increase
- Grade A-C still manageable but require monitoring

## Capital & Provision Requirements

### Severe Recession Scenario
- **Additional Provisions Needed**: $65.2M (4.5x baseline)
- **Capital Buffer Required**: $15.5M (vs $5.8M baseline)
- **Credit Income Impact**: -$88.9M (turns deeply negative)

### Moderate Recession Scenario
- **Additional Provisions**: $45.0M (3.1x baseline)
- **Capital Buffer**: $11.5M
- **Credit Income Impact**: -$51.0M

### Break-even Analysis
- Portfolio can absorb **Mild Recession** with existing provisions
- **Moderate Recession** requires $45M additional capital
- **Severe Recession** would require significant capital injection or portfolio restructuring

## Methodology

### PD Uplift Model
```
PD_stressed = invlogit(
    logit(PD_baseline)
    + Î²_GDP Ã— Î”GDP
    + Î²_unemployment Ã— Î”unemployment
    + Î²_rates Ã— Î”rates
    + Î²_sector
    + Î²_grade
)
```

**Elasticities Used:**
- GDP Growth: -0.20 (negative growth increases PD)
- Unemployment: +0.35
- Interest Rates: +0.15
- CPI: +0.10

**Sector Betas:** Manufacturing (+0.05), Retail (+0.10), Construction (+0.12)  
**Grade Betas:** A (-0.10), B (-0.05), C (0.0), D (+0.05), E (+0.10), F (+0.20), G (+0.30)

### Impact Calculations
- **NPL Proxy**: PD Ã— EAD
- **Expected Loss**: PD Ã— LGD Ã— EAD
- **Provision**: Coverage Ã— EL (100% coverage assumed)
- **Capital**: 8% Ã— EAD Ã— âˆš(PD Ã— LGD) (simplified Basel approach)
- **Credit Income**: APR Ã— EAD Ã— (1 - PD) - EL

## Risk Mitigation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-3 months)
1. **Increase Provisions**: Build provision buffer to $80M to cover Moderate scenario
2. **Enhance Monitoring**: Weekly tracking of early warning signals for grades D-G
3. **Sector Review**: Deep dive into Construction and Retail sectors

### Medium-term (3-12 months)
1. **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Reduce exposure to high-risk grades (F-G) by 20%
2. **Pricing Adjustment**: Increase APR for grades D-E to compensate for higher risk
3. **Collateral Review**: Re-evaluate LGD assumptions, improve collateral coverage

### Long-term (12+ months)
1. **Stress Testing Cadence**: Quarterly stress tests with updated macro forecasts
2. **Dynamic Provisioning**: Implement forward-looking ECL model
3. **Capital Planning**: Maintain 15% capital buffer above regulatory minimum

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

**PD Uplift Sensitivity** (Severe Recession):
- Elasticity +20%: NPL increases to $195M (+$163M vs baseline)
- Elasticity -20%: NPL at $160M (+$128M vs baseline)

**LGD Sensitivity**:
- LGD +10pp (55% avg): Provision requirement +$13M
- LGD -10pp (35% avg): Provision requirement -$13M

## Conclusion

The stress test reveals significant vulnerabilities in severe downside scenarios. While the portfolio can withstand mild economic turbulence, a moderate-to-severe recession would require substantial capital injections and active portfolio management.

**Traffic Light Assessment:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Mild Recession**: Manageable with existing buffers
- ðŸŸ¡ **Moderate Recession**: Requires immediate capital planning
- ðŸ”´ **Severe Recession**: Critical - immediate action required

**Next Steps:**
1. Present findings to Credit Committee and Board
2. Develop contingency funding plan for $100M provision buffer
3. Implement enhanced monitoring for construction and high-risk grades
4. Update ICAAP and recovery planning with stress test results
